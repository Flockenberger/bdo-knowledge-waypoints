**Please note that Black Desert Online only supports importing up to 5 waypoints at a time**.

Before importing, check and adjust which waypoints you want to use to avoid errors or missing data.

They may instead point to locations such as mobs (monsters) or other entities that need to be defeated in order to gain knowledge.
